# Modeling and Application
_to where i dump all my research interests_

Hello there! I am Dan and I decided to start picking my waste up and compile them here. 

This repository should include my research progress throughout the year including the figures, codes, and the main results of my study. This will be updated from time to time so you can see my latest progress.

Should you have any ideas, comments, or questions as to clear things up, don't hesitate to connect with me using my active email address dorapa@up.edu.ph.

I hope to see you at the end of this journey and hopefully share the results of this study to you! 

`Main Goal: To create a meaningful study and get it published to various journals!`

_Note: This will get updated every week if there's any important that is to be uploaded._
